            A haiku that expresses your inner geek. Talk about Dr. Who, Battlestar Galactica, Zelda, Ruby on Rails, etc. As long as it's in the form of a haiku (a poem with 17 syllables), you should be fine.

            %strong Haiku? What..
            You might remember them from elementary school. It's a poem with 17 syllables. They go like this:
            %blockquote
              %small
                One show did it right
                %br
                Battlestar Galactica
                %br
                "Sir" means 'boss' not 'man'
            Pro Tip: Having trouble keeping track of syllables? Clap as you talk it out.
